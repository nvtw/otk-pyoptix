# warp-optix

Warp ray tracing with PyOptiX 9.1 and DLSS Ray Reconstruction.
Write ray-generation, hit, miss, and callable programs as Warp kernels, or use
the included path tracer. Applications import `warp_optix`. Installation brings
in `pyoptix==9.1.0` for the standard OptiX bindings and builds a small extension
for DLSS, cooperative vectors, and missing binding fields and fixes.

## Installation

Build from the repository root with Python 3.10+, a CUDA Toolkit and a C++17
compiler. GPU execution requires a compatible NVIDIA driver. OptiX headers and
DLSS SDK 310.9.1 are fetched automatically.

The wheel includes unmodified OptiX SDK 9.1.0 headers under `warp_optix/include`
for runtime kernel compilation, so a separate OptiX SDK installation is not
required. The headers retain their NVIDIA SDK terms in `OptiX_LICENSE.txt`,
identified in package metadata as `LicenseRef-NVIDIA-OptiX`. Public header
redistribution remains subject to written confirmation from the OptiX owner
and legal review.

```powershell
pip install .
# Editable development with viewer dependencies:
pip install -e ".[pathtracing,ui,usd]"
```

This builds a platform wheel containing the Python package and supplemental
extension. PyOptiX is a separate dependency, installed automatically. Extras
are `pathtracing`, `ui`, `usd`, and `training`.

For a repository-local uv environment:

```bash
uv sync --python 3.12 --no-default-groups --extra pathtracing --extra ui
uv run --no-sync python examples_warp/example_warp_optix_pathtraced_hairball.py
```

## Public API

```python
import warp as wp
import warp_optix as wo
from warp_optix.pathtracing import PathTracerAPI
```

For custom ray tracers, OptiX programs are ordinary Warp kernels and launches
mirror `wp.launch`:

```python
@wp.kernel(module="unique")
def render(scene: wp.uint64, image: wp.array2d[float]):
    y, x = wp.tid()
    origin = wp.vec3(float(x), float(y), 10.0)
    hit = wo.closest_hit(scene, origin, wp.vec3(0.0, 0.0, -1.0), 0.0, 100.0, wp.uint32(0xFF), wp.uint32(0))
    image[y, x] = hit.t

ctx = wo.create_context("cuda:0")
gas = wo.build_accel(ctx, [wo.triangles(vertices, indices)])  # Warp device arrays
pipeline = wo.create_pipeline(ctx, render)
wo.launch(pipeline, dim=(480, 640), inputs=[gas.handle, image])
wo.destroy_context(ctx)
```

The raygen kernel's arguments are the launch parameters. Acceleration
structures reference the caller's device arrays, which must outlive them;
instances are written on the device with `wo.make_instance()` and refit with
`wo.update_accel()`. Builds, refits, and launches are asynchronous on Warp's
current stream or an explicitly supplied `wp.Stream`; only compaction
synchronizes. `destroy_context()` synchronizes the device and destroys every
pipeline and module created from the context; keep acceleration structures and
pipelines referenced until it returns.

See the [API guide](warp_optix/README.md), [migration notes](docs/migration-0.2.md),
and runnable [examples](examples_warp/README.md).

## DLSS builds

The package includes DLSS bindings and the Release runtime library.
Applications can enable DLSS Ray Reconstruction on supported hardware.
`DlssRRContext.init(projectId, ...)` takes the application's NGX project ID;
its `featureSearchPath` defaults to the packaged runtime, and
`enableLogging=True` forwards NGX messages to the Python logger
`warp_optix.dlss`. `DlssRRInitInfo.preset` selects the Ray Reconstruction model.
That runtime is covered by the NVIDIA RTX SDKs license in `DLSS_LICENSE.txt`,
identified in package metadata as `LicenseRef-NVIDIA-RTX-SDK`. It is not
licensed under Apache 2.0. Public distribution remains subject to the release
review and written SDK-owner approval.
Build the package:

```powershell
uv build --wheel
```

`DLSS_ROOT` selects a local SDK; `PYOPTIX_AUTO_DOWNLOAD_DLSS=OFF`
disables downloading. `CMAKE_ARGS` and DLSS version/hash overrides configure
the build. On Windows, `CUDA_PATH` or `CUDA_BIN_DIR` helps locate CUDA DLLs.

## Advanced native interface

```python
from warp_optix import native
print(native.dlss_support_available())
print(native.dlss_rr_available(project_id))
```

`native` exposes PyOptiX's API plus the supplemental bindings. Native
objects use explicit destruction. `create_context()` returns a PyOptiX
`DeviceContext`; destroy it with `destroy_context()`, which also destroys the
pipelines and modules created from it.
Standard objects are the dependency's actual `optix` types; both packages can
be imported in either order. The supplement adds methods and fields to those
types and repairs module-metadata and continuation-callable handling. Keep
objects on their owning OptiX/CUDA context and obey their lifetimes.

PyOptiX 9.1.0 has no public native-handle API. The extension therefore uses a
small, version-pinned pybind11 bridge and checks shared type identities and
sizes before accessing them. Builds reject OptiX headers that differ from the
PyOptiX dependency pin; imports reject mismatched compiled SDK versions before
attaching bindings. Both extensions must use a compatible pybind11
major version and C++ ABI. If the import reports an ABI mismatch, rebuild both
packages with pybind11 3.x. See [dependency maintenance](docs/pyoptix-dependency.md).

The distribution version is 0.2.0; the binding version is 9.1.0.

## Tests and dependency maintenance

Install feature extras and pytest, then run the test suite:

```powershell
python -m pytest warp_optix/tests
python -m pytest examples_warp/neural_texture
```

Tests can be selected with the markers registered in `pyproject.toml`
(`gpu`, `slow`, `usd`, `render`, `training`), for example `-m "not slow"`.

The suite includes regression coverage for the dependency and supplemental
bindings. The dependency is maintained in
[NVIDIA/otk-pyoptix](https://github.com/NVIDIA/otk-pyoptix). See
[maintenance instructions](docs/pyoptix-dependency.md). Extracted binding additions
retain their BSD license; Warp integration sources use Apache 2.0. OptiX and DLSS retain their
NVIDIA license terms. License texts accompany the distribution.

Runnable samples are in `examples_warp/`.

## Licenses and contributions

See [third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt) for component licenses and
source provenance. `src/extension.cpp`, `src/pyoptix_compat.h`, and
`CMakeLists.txt` use BSD-3-Clause; NVIDIA-authored Warp integration uses
Apache-2.0. The aggregate package metadata also identifies the OptiX and DLSS SDK terms.

This project is currently not accepting contributions.
We plan to accept outside contributions in the future. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for updates.

## CUDA graph limitation

OptiX launch capture is currently unsupported. Tests on the RTX 3080 with
driver 610.74 reproduced illegal memory access during graph replay and invalid
resource events during context destruction; on Blackwell with driver 595.99,
OptiX launches and acceleration-structure builds are not recorded into the
captured graph at all. `launch()`, `build_accel()`, `update_accel()`, and
`create_pipeline()` reject an active capture before submitting native work.
Capture ordinary Warp work in graphs and submit OptiX work between those
graphs on the same stream. DLSS and ordinary stream ordering are supported.

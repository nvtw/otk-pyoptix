OptiX Path Tracing Package.

Python/OptiX path tracing components providing hardware-accelerated ray
tracing with PBR materials.

Components:
    - camera: First-person/orbit camera with matrix generation
    - materials: PBR material management
    - scene: Mesh and acceleration structure management
    - tonemap: HDR to LDR tonemapping
    - pathtracing_viewer: OptiX/DLSS rendering engine
    - viewer: Standalone and framework-compatible viewer API

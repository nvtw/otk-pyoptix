# warp_optix

OptiX ray tracing for [Warp](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp), using PyOptiX and a small supplemental native extension.

Acceleration structures are built directly from Warp device arrays, OptiX programs are ordinary
Warp kernels, and launches mirror `wp.launch`:

```python
import warp as wp
import warp_optix as wo


@wp.kernel(module="unique")
def render(scene: wp.uint64, depth: wp.array2d[float]):
    y, x = wp.tid()
    origin = wp.vec3(float(x) / 64.0 - 1.0, float(y) / 64.0 - 1.0, 5.0)
    hit = wo.closest_hit(scene, origin, wp.vec3(0.0, 0.0, -1.0), 0.0, 100.0, wp.uint32(0xFF), wp.uint32(0))
    depth[y, x] = hit.t  # wo.MISS when nothing was hit


ctx = wo.create_context()
gas = wo.build_accel(ctx, [wo.triangles(vertices, indices)], compact=True)
pipeline = wo.create_pipeline(ctx, render)
depth = wp.empty((128, 128), dtype=float)
wo.launch(pipeline, dim=depth.shape, inputs=[gas.handle, depth])
wo.destroy_context(ctx)  # synchronizes, then destroys the pipeline and modules
```

Importing `warp_optix` registers the `wp.optix_*` device builtins with Warp. They are valid only
inside kernels compiled into a pipeline by `wo.create_pipeline()`.

## Install

Install from the repository root; PyOptiX is installed as a dependency:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

`warp_optix` requires `warp-lang>=1.17`. See the [migration notes](../docs/migration-0.2.md) for the
changes from the earlier helper API.

## Programs and pipelines

Every OptiX program is a `@wp.kernel(module="unique")` kernel. The raygen kernel's arguments
become the pipeline's launch parameters, and `wp.tid()` returns the launch index, so the same
`dim` is used as with `wp.launch` (`dim=(height, width)` gives an OptiX launch of `width x
height`). Every other program — miss, closest-hit, any-hit, intersection, direct callable, and
exception — declares any subset of the raygen arguments **by name with identical types**:

```python
@wp.struct
class Payload:
    color: wp.vec3


@wp.kernel(module="unique")
def raygen(scene: wp.uint64, tint: wp.vec3, image: wp.array2d[wp.vec3]):
    y, x = wp.tid()
    payload = Payload()
    wp.optix_trace(
        scene, wp.vec3(float(x), float(y), 5.0), wp.vec3(0.0, 0.0, -1.0), 0.0, 100.0, 0.0,
        wp.uint32(0xFF), wp.uint32(0), wp.uint32(0), wp.uint32(1), wp.uint32(0), payload,
    )
    image[y, x] = payload.color


@wp.kernel(module="unique")
def shade(tint: wp.vec3):  # binds raygen's `tint`
    payload = Payload()
    payload.color = tint * wp.optix_get_ray_tmax()
    wp.optix_store_payload(payload)


@wp.kernel(module="unique")
def background():
    wp.optix_set_payload_0(wp.float_to_uint32(0.0))


pipeline = wo.create_pipeline(
    ctx,
    raygen,
    miss=[background],
    hit_groups=[wo.HitGroup(closest_hit=shade)],
    payload_words=3,
)
wo.launch(pipeline, dim=image.shape, inputs=[gas.handle, wp.vec3(1.0, 0.5, 0.2), image])
```

`wo.create_pipeline(ctx, raygen, *, miss, hit_groups, ray_types, callables, exception,
payload_words, attribute_words, max_trace_depth, max_traversable_depth, graph_flags, motion_blur,
max_registers, device)` compiles all programs into one module and builds the shader binding table:

- `miss` lists one miss program per ray type; `None` is a record without a program.
- `hit_groups` holds `wo.HitGroup(closest_hit=, any_hit=, intersection=, builtin=)` entries.
  The hit record for geometry type `g` and ray type `r` is `hit_groups[g * ray_types + r]`;
  trace with `sbt_offset=r` and `sbt_stride=ray_types`, and give instances `sbt_offset=g *
  ray_types`. `builtin=wo.PrimitiveType.*` selects OptiX's built-in curve intersector; a
  group with an `intersection` program serves custom primitives. Primitive-type flags are derived
  from the groups.
- `callables` are direct-callable programs, invoked with `wp.optix_direct_call(index)` in list
  order. Callables use a no-argument, void interface: they read launch parameters and write
  referenced Warp arrays.
- `exception` enables user exceptions. Raise one with `wp.optix_throw_exception(code, ...)` (up
  to eight `wp.uint32` details) and read it with `wp.optix_get_exception_code()` and
  `wp.optix_get_exception_detail_<i>()`.

`wo.launch(pipeline, dim, inputs, stream=None)` writes the launch parameters with a Warp kernel
on `stream` and then launches OptiX on the same stream. Neither step synchronizes the host.
OptiX does not record its work into CUDA graphs, so `wo.launch`, `wo.build_accel`,
`wo.update_accel`, and `wo.create_pipeline` raise `RuntimeError` during stream capture. Kernels written against a single launch-parameter struct
(`def raygen(params: LaunchParams)`) work unchanged: launch them with `inputs=[params]`.

`wo.ProgramKind` names the program kinds and their OptiX entry-name prefixes;
`wo.constants` provides OptiX ray, instance, geometry, and build flag values usable both in kernels
(via `wp.uint32(...)`) and on the host. Host-side arguments also accept the typed enums
`wo.BuildFlags`, `wo.GeometryFlags`, `wo.InstanceFlags`, `wo.PrimitiveType`, and
`wo.TraversableGraphFlags`.

## Ray queries without hit programs

`wo.closest_hit(traversable, origin, direction, tmin, tmax, visibility_mask, ray_flags) -> wo.Hit`
and `wo.any_hit(traversable, origin, direction, tmin, tmax, visibility_mask) -> bool` traverse with
`wp.optix_traverse()` and read the result from the OptiX hit object, so a raygen-only pipeline can
query built-in geometry. `Hit.t` is `wo.MISS` when nothing was hit; after `closest_hit` the
`wp.optix_hit_object_*` builtins expose barycentrics, attributes, and transforms until the next
traversal.

## Acceleration structures

Build inputs reference caller-owned Warp **device** arrays, which must outlive every
acceleration structure built from them:

| Builder | Input |
| --- | --- |
| `wo.triangles(vertices, indices, flags=)` | `vec3` (or `float32[N, 3]`) vertices, int32/uint32 index triplets; a list of vertex arrays gives motion keys |
| `wo.aabbs(bounds, flags=, sbt_indices=)` | `float32[N, 6]` `(min, max)` boxes for custom primitives |
| `wo.curves(vertices, widths, indices, curve_type=, flags=)` | control points, per-point radii, first control point of each segment |
| `wo.instances(records)` | `wp.array(dtype=wo.Instance)` |

Geometry defaults to `GeometryFlags.DISABLE_ANYHIT`; pass `flags=wo.GeometryFlags.NONE` when an
any-hit program must run.

`wo.build_accel(ctx, inputs, flags=, compact=, motion=, stream=, device=) -> wo.Accel` builds on a
Warp stream without synchronizing. `compact=True` synchronizes once to shrink static structures.
`wo.update_accel(ctx, accel, rebuild=False, stream=)` refits a structure built with
`BUILD_FLAG_ALLOW_UPDATE` to its inputs' current contents (or rebuilds it in place with
`rebuild=True`) using the retained scratch buffer, so it neither allocates nor synchronizes.

`wo.Instance` is the 80-byte `OptixInstance` layout as a Warp struct, and the `wo.make_instance()`
Warp function writes one from a rotation (with optional scale/shear), translation, traversable,
instance ID, SBT offset, visibility mask, and flags. Instance records are therefore written on the
GPU, e.g. one per simulated world:

```python
@wp.kernel
def write_instances(gas: wp.uint64, poses: wp.array[wp.transform], records: wp.array[wo.Instance]):
    i = wp.tid()
    pose = poses[i]
    records[i] = wo.make_instance(
        wp.quat_to_matrix(wp.transform_get_rotation(pose)), wp.transform_get_translation(pose),
        gas, wp.uint32(i), wp.uint32(0), wp.uint32(0xFF), wp.uint32(0),
    )


records = wp.empty(world_count, dtype=wo.Instance)
wp.launch(write_instances, dim=world_count, inputs=[gas.handle, poses, records])
ias = wo.build_accel(ctx, [wo.instances(records)], flags=wo.BuildFlags.ALLOW_UPDATE)
# Each step: rewrite the records, then refit.
wp.launch(write_instances, dim=world_count, inputs=[gas.handle, poses, records])
ias = wo.update_accel(ctx, ias)
```

For vertex motion blur, pass a list of vertex keys and OptiX motion options, then enable motion
on the pipeline and trace with a ray time:

```python
from warp_optix import native

motion = native.MotionOptions(numKeys=2, flags=native.MOTION_FLAG_NONE, timeBegin=0.0, timeEnd=1.0)
gas = wo.build_accel(ctx, [wo.triangles([keys0, keys1], indices)], motion=motion)
pipeline = wo.create_pipeline(ctx, raygen, ..., motion_blur=True)
```

## Device builtins

Warp kernels expose the common OptiX hit context directly: ray origin/direction (world and
object space), `tmin`/`tmax`, time, flags, and visibility mask; instance ID and index; primitive
index, SBT GAS index, GAS handle, and primitive type; front/back-face tests; and
point/vector/normal transforms in both directions. Names follow Warp's snake-case convention, for
example `wp.optix_get_instance_index()` and
`wp.optix_transform_point_from_world_to_object_space()`. Payloads are moved with
`wp.optix_set_payload_<i>()`/`wp.optix_get_payload_<i>()` or as whole Warp structs with
`wp.optix_load_payload()`/`wp.optix_store_payload()`.

Inside an intersection program, use `wp.optix_get_object_ray_origin()`,
`wp.optix_get_object_ray_direction()`, and `wp.optix_report_intersection()`, which accepts a hit
distance, hit kind, and zero to eight `wp.uint32` attributes. Closest-hit and any-hit programs read
them with `wp.optix_get_attribute_0()` through `wp.optix_get_attribute_7()`;
`wp.float_to_uint32()` and `wp.uint32_to_float()` reinterpret floats.

### Geometry and transform queries

Triangle hits expose barycentrics, object-space vertices (`wp.optix_get_triangle_vertex_data()`
returns a `wp.mat33` whose rows are the three vertices), and generic and triangle-specific face
predicates. Built-in curve hits expose their object-space control points as fixed Warp matrices
whose rows are `(x, y, z, radius)`, and `wp.optix_get_curve_parameter()`:

| Query family | Return type |
| --- | --- |
| Linear curve | `2 x 4` float matrix |
| Quadratic B-spline and ribbon | `3 x 4` float matrix |
| Cubic B-spline, Catmull-Rom, and cubic Bezier | `wp.mat44` |

Ribbons additionally expose their two intersection parameters and derived normal. Geometry
current-hit queries are valid in any-hit and closest-hit programs for the corresponding primitive
type.

The current transform list can be inspected with `wp.optix_get_transform_list_size()`,
`wp.optix_get_transform_list_handle(index)`, and
`wp.optix_get_transform_type_from_handle(handle)`. Composite affine transforms are returned as
ordinary homogeneous `wp.mat44` values:

```python
object_to_world = wp.optix_get_object_to_world_transform_matrix()
world_to_object = wp.optix_get_world_to_object_transform_matrix()
```

The current transform matrix and transform-list queries are valid in intersection, any-hit, and
closest-hit programs. Random-access geometry fetches and raw SDK transform pointers are
deliberately not exposed.

### Cooperative vectors

OptiX 9 cooperative vectors are native SDK facilities, not Warp operations. The Python extension
exposes the host-side SDK pieces needed to prepare matrices:

- `DEVICE_PROPERTY_COOP_VEC` and `DevicePropertyCoopVecFlags` for support queries.
- `CoopVecElemType`, `CoopVecMatrixLayout`, and `CoopVecMatrixDescription`.
- `DeviceContext.coopVecMatrixComputeSize()` and `DeviceContext.coopVecMatrixConvert()`.

The conversion call is asynchronous and follows OptiX's 64-byte alignment and allocation-lifetime
requirements. Device-side intrinsics use explicit output vectors, the convention required by
Warp's public addon API:

```python
Vec32h = wp.types.vector(length=32, dtype=wp.float16)
Vec16h = wp.types.vector(length=16, dtype=wp.float16)


@wp.kernel(module="unique")
def closest_hit(matrices: wp.uint64, weight_offset: wp.uint32, biases: wp.uint64, bias_offset: wp.uint32):
    inputs = Vec32h(wp.float16(0.0))
    outputs = Vec16h()
    wp.optix_coop_vec_matmul_bias_fp8_e4m3(
        inputs, matrices, weight_offset, biases, bias_offset, wp.uint32(0), outputs
    )
```

The registered family includes load, conversion, elementwise arithmetic, `exp2`, `log2`, `tanh`,
fused multiply-add, reductions, outer products, matrix-size queries, and matrix multiply variants
for FP16, FP8 E4M3/E5M2, signed int8, and unsigned int8. Named matrix variants use an
inference-optimal, non-transposed matrix with the element interpretation in the function name.

## OpenGL display

`warp_optix.gl` provides optional pyglet-based helpers for interactive examples:
`GLInteropViewer` presents a CUDA-mapped `uint32` RGBA pixel buffer each frame without a host
copy, and `GLLineOverlay` draws depth-tested lines over it (see below).

## Path-tracing viewer

The example path tracer is also installed as `warp_optix.pathtracing`. Install
its windowing and image extras with:

```bash
pip install -e ".[pathtracing]"
```

`PathTracingViewer` is a standalone OptiX path-tracing viewer with DLSS Ray
Reconstruction. `PathTracingViewerBackend` exposes a renderer-facing `log_*`
API without importing a simulation framework.

### Denoising and upscaling

`PathTracerAPI` and `PathTracingViewer` accept the same optional backend
selector and support switching without rebuilding the scene:

```python
from warp_optix.pathtracing import PathTracerAPI

api = PathTracerAPI(denoiser="dlss", dlss_quality="quality", optix_upscale=True)
api.initialize()
api.set_denoiser("optix")
api.set_denoiser("dlss")  # Retains the DLSS quality setting.
api.set_denoiser("optix", optix_upscale=False)  # Native-resolution denoising.
```

`denoiser="auto"` prefers DLSS RR, then OptiX, then raw rendering. Explicit
`"dlss"` and `"optix"` selections require successful initialization;
`"none"` disables denoising. Inspect `active_denoiser` and `denoiser_error`
to see the selected backend and automatic fallback diagnostics. Omitting
`denoiser` preserves the existing `enable_dlss_rr` behavior, including its
raw-rendering fallback. An explicit selector takes precedence over that flag.

DLSS queries NGX for input dimensions using the existing `dlss_quality` modes.
OptiX uses temporal denoising at native resolution by default;
`optix_upscale=True` selects its temporal 2x upscaling model. Odd output sizes
use rounded-up input dimensions and crop the extra output row or column.
Switches and resizes reset reconstruction history.
Use `reset_temporal_history()` after a discontinuous scene change. OptiX
respects `samples_per_frame`; DLSS continues to render one sample per frame.
Both backends share the renderer's guide buffers and final tonemapping path.
The rendering panel exposes backend selection and their quality settings.

For custom Warp renderers, `warp_optix.pathtracing` also exports
`DenoiserInputs` and `OptixDenoiser`. Pass float4 HDR color, float4 world-space
normals, float4 albedo, and float2 current-to-previous motion in input pixels
(without jitter). The wrapper manages scratch/state allocations, temporal
history, and stream ordering:

```python
from warp_optix.pathtracing import DenoiserInputs, OptixDenoiser

denoiser = OptixDenoiser(context, width, height, stream=stream, upscale=True)
filtered = denoiser.apply(DenoiserInputs(color, normal, albedo, motion), reset=True)
# Consume filtered on the same stream; it is borrowed until the next apply().
denoiser.close()
```

The supplemental extension adds the temporal models and guide-layer fields
to the PyOptiX dependency's denoiser bindings. `context` is the context from `wo.create_context()`.

### Interactive viewer features

The optional interactive features are installed separately:

```bash
pip install -e ".[pathtracing,ui]"
```

The viewer follows the earlier hybrid viewer controls:

- WASD or arrow keys move the camera; Q/E move along the model up axis.
- Left drag looks around and the scroll wheel changes field of view.
- Right click and drag picks bodies when a `picking_factory` is supplied.
- Space pauses, Escape closes, and 0-8 select path-tracing debug buffers.
- P saves a screenshot.

`register_ui_callback()` adds application controls to the optional ImGui panel.
The panel also exposes rendering statistics, DLSS state, visualization flags,
camera state, debug buffers, picking, pause, and screenshot controls. Picking
uses an optional `picking_factory` supplied by the application when constructing
the viewer.

The backend accepts Warp arrays for meshes, transforms, colors, and material
parameters. It handles X/Y/Z up-axis conversion, mesh and instance
caching, visibility updates, and roughness/metallic PBR materials. Its default
physical-sky values and sRGB-to-linear color conversion intentionally match
the earlier hybrid viewer, including the light ground, slight haze, and soft
horizon used for untextured simulation geometry.

The four material values passed to `log_instances()` are roughness, metallic,
U subdivisions, and V subdivisions. Positive subdivision values enable a
procedural UV checker overlay; alternating cells multiply the sampled base
color by `base_color_scale` (default `0.75`). A zero subdivision disables the
overlay. The same `u_subdiv`, `v_subdiv`, and `base_color_scale` controls are
available when creating PBR or glTF materials directly.

The framework-neutral class can also be driven directly through
`log_mesh()`, `log_instances()`, `begin_frame()`, and `end_frame()`. Textured
glTF and USD scenes remain available through `PathTracerAPI`; USD loading uses
the optional `usd-core` extra and maps UsdPreviewSurface and common NVIDIA MDL
inputs to the same internal PBR material representation. Composed DomeLight
HDR textures can be enabled explicitly with
`load_scene_from_usd(..., load_usd_environment=True)`. The framework
`log_mesh` adapter currently maps vertex colors and PBR values but does not
ingest its optional texture argument.

`PathTracerAPI` submits every OptiX launch directly on its render stream;
OptiX work cannot be recorded into CUDA graphs.

Large dynamic arrow sets use one fixed-capacity native-curve geometry rather
than one OptiX instance per arrow. Each arrow is a constant-radius shaft plus
a linearly tapered tip. Inactive slots have zero width, so a changing contact
count does not reallocate buffers or rebuild the whole scene. By default only
the arrow GAS is rebuilt, followed by a TLAS update:

```python
material = api.create_pbr_material((0.9, 0.25, 0.03), 0.65, 0.0)
arrows = api.create_arrow_batch(
    capacity=max_contact_count,
    small_radius=0.002,
    large_radius=0.006,
    tip_length_ratio=0.2,
    material_id=material,
)
api.build_scene()

# CUDA wp.vec3 buffers with at least max_contact_count entries. The one-element
# CUDA int32 count avoids a device-to-host synchronization when contacts vary;
# it is clamped to max_contact_count on-device.
api.update_arrow_batch_device(
    arrows,
    contact_starts_cuda,
    contact_ends_cuda,
    contact_count_cuda,
    material_ids=contact_material_ids_cuda,  # Optional int32 ID per arrow.
    stream=simulation_stream,
)
```

The host equivalent is `update_arrow_batch(arrows, starts, ends)`. Per-arrow
materials use the existing per-curve-primitive material table; the API assigns
the same ID to an arrow's shaft and tip. When updating several dynamic batches,
pass `rebuild_tlas=False` to each update and call `api.rebuild_tlas()` once at
the end.

A fast GAS rebuild is deliberately the default because contact ordering may
shuffle completely between frames. Use `rebuild_gas=False` only when arrow IDs
remain spatially coherent; refitting is correct in either case, but arbitrary
reordering can substantially degrade the refitted BVH's traversal quality.

For contact vectors that only need lines, `GLLineOverlay` avoids OptiX GAS and
TLAS updates entirely. It follows Newton's wireframe renderer: a geometry
shader expands `GL_LINES` into constant-pixel-width quads. A fixed-capacity VBO
is registered with CUDA and updated directly from device arrays; the active
count and ordering may change on every frame. The path tracer's positive
view-space depth is transferred through a CUDA/OpenGL PBO to an R32F texture,
so fragments behind path-traced geometry are discarded:

```python
from warp_optix.gl import GLLineOverlay

overlay = GLLineOverlay(
    gl_viewer.gl,
    capacity=max_contact_count,
    device="cuda",
    depth_buffer=api.linear_depth_output,
    stream=gl_viewer.render_stream,
)
overlay.update_device(contact_starts_cuda, contact_ends_cuda, contact_colors_cuda)

def draw_contacts():
    camera = api.viewer.camera
    overlay.draw(
        camera.get_view_matrix(),
        camera.get_projection_matrix(),
        (gl_viewer.width, gl_viewer.height),
        camera_near=camera.near,
        camera_far=camera.far,
    )

gl_viewer.set_draw_overlay(draw_contacts)
```

Call `set_depth_buffer(api.linear_depth_output)` after a path-tracer resize and
`destroy()` while the OpenGL context is current. See
`examples_warp/example_warp_optix_pathtraced_contact_lines.py` for 100k
contacts with a changing count and fully shuffled ordering.

The high-level curve API also accepts native cubic Bézier segments. Their
radius is a cubic Bézier scalar using the same parameter and control topology
as position:

```python
curve = api.create_curve(control_points, radii, basis="cubic_bezier")
api.create_instance(curve)
```

Omitting indices requires `3*N + 1` control points and creates starts
`0, 3, 6, ...`; explicit starts can pack disjoint strands in one geometry.

USD loads also retain a path-addressable transform hierarchy instead of
baking composed transforms into vertices:

```python
api.load_scene_from_usd("scene.usd")
usd = api.usd_scene
body = usd.require_transform("/World/Robot/base")

# Host batch (local 4x4 matrices).
usd.update_local_transforms([body], matrices)

# Zero-staging CUDA batch on a caller-owned Warp stream.
transform_count_cuda = wp.array([capacity], dtype=wp.int32, device="cuda")
usd.update_local_transforms_device(
    transform_count_cuda, body_ids_cuda, local_mat44_cuda, stream=simulation_stream
)
# Newton-style wp.transform + wp.vec3 scale arrays are accepted directly too.
usd.update_local_transform_trs_device(
    transform_count_cuda,
    body_ids_cuda,
    local_poses_cuda,
    local_scales_cuda,
    stream=simulation_stream,
)

# Or decouple hierarchy writes from the OptiX update.
usd.update_local_transforms_device(
    transform_count_cuda,
    body_ids_cuda,
    local_mat44_cuda,
    stream=simulation_stream,
    rebuild_tlas=False,
)
usd.update_tlas(stream=simulation_stream)
```

The ID and transform arrays define a fixed launch capacity. A CUDA kernel may
change the single active-count value inside a captured graph to update any
prefix of those arrays without graph recapture or host synchronization.

`usd.transforms` enumerates a stable `USDTransformHandle` for every composed
transformable prim path. `usd.get_transform(path)` performs a non-throwing
lookup, `usd.get_prim(path)` accesses any prim on the retained OpenUSD stage,
and the CUDA local/world `wp.mat44` arrays are exposed after scene build. A
batch composes hierarchy levels, updates all affected OptiX instance and
motion-vector transforms, and updates the TLAS on the selected CUDA stream.
With `rebuild_tlas=False`, the device methods launch only Warp kernels and
are CUDA graph capture compatible after one warm-up call; call `update_tlas()`
outside the capture, because OptiX acceleration builds and updates cannot be
recorded into graphs. Keep the device batch length and array addresses stable
across graph replays; a batch length of one is supported. The NumPy
convenience method performs allocation/upload and is intentionally not the
graph-capture path.

The old hybrid viewer's Vulkan-backed OpenGL transform VBO was specific to its
C# bridge. Compatibility queries remain available, but return unavailable;
dynamic simulation transforms instead use Warp arrays through `log_instances()`
or `update_instance_transforms()` and trigger an OptiX TLAS refit. Transform
matrix construction is vectorized before the retained OptiX instance buffer is
updated. Window presentation uses CUDA/OpenGL interop with Warp's copy fallback
when direct registration is unavailable.

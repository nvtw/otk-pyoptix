# Maintaining the PyOptiX dependency

`pyproject.toml` pins `pyoptix==9.1.0`. PyOptiX owns the standard native types,
contexts, geometry, pipelines, launches, and denoisers. We no longer build or
merge a complete copy of its bindings.

CMake reads that exact pin to select the OptiX header tag and checks the actual
`OPTIX_VERSION` in `optix.h` before compiling, including when a local SDK is
supplied through `FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_OPTIX_HEADERS`. A compiler assertion
also protects the 9.1.0 wrapper bridge against unexpected include paths or a
pin change without updating the bridge. At import, the versions compiled into
PyOptiX (`optix.version()`) and our extension (`_ext.optix_version()`) must both
be 9.1.0. Mismatches raise `ImportError` before upstream types are modified.
An isolated build does not inspect the user's installed PyOptiX binary; the
import check catches dependency binaries built with different headers.

`src/extension.cpp` registers only additional cooperative-vector and DLSS types
and operations. `_backend.py` composes these with the dependency and repairs
two upstream 9.1.0 bugs: ignored module compile metadata and a missing module
in continuation-only callable descriptors. Temporal denoiser properties are
added to the existing upstream types, so upstream functions accept them.
Importing this package leaves `sys.modules["optix"]` pointing to real PyOptiX.

The dependency does not expose native handles or a C interface. Until upstream
provides one, `src/pyoptix_compat.h` retains four upstream wrapper definitions
for cross-module pybind11 casts. These are private ABI, not a general plugin
interface. The package checks the dependency version and the extension checks
registered type identities and sizes before accessing objects. Different
pybind11 major versions or incompatible C++ ABIs fail with an import error.
Current source builds use pybind11 3.x. A public borrowed-handle/capsule API
upstream would allow the private wrapper bridge to be removed.

When updating PyOptiX:

1. Compare those four wrapper definitions with the released dependency and
   align the pinned version, OptiX headers, and supported build ABI.
2. Remove supplemental operations or repairs that upstream now provides.
3. Run `python -m pytest warp_optix/tests`, build both DLSS variants, and test
   clean wheel and editable installs.
4. Verify both import orders, upstream type identity, module metadata,
   continuation callables, temporal denoising, cooperative-vector conversion,
   and a DLSS frame on a supported GPU.
5. Inspect wheels: `warp_optix/_ext` is expected; `warp_optix/_bindings`,
   `optix/_optix`, and a top-level replacement `optix` package are not.

The inherited PyOptiX example and test trees have been removed. Runnable samples
live in `examples_warp/`; dependency and supplemental-binding regressions live
in `warp_optix/tests`. Licenses for extracted binding code are retained.
OptiX SDK 9.1.0 headers are fetched for compilation and installed unmodified
under `warp_optix/include`, together with the upstream SDK license, in both
DLSS variants. Runtime lookup uses the package directory or, for editable
installs, the native extension's directory. No separate SDK install is required.
Before public release, obtain written confirmation for redistribution of the
source headers from the OptiX owner and legal review. The SDK terms remain
separate from the Apache-2.0 and BSD-3-Clause source licenses.
